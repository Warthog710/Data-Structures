# Data-Structures
This is a course in data structures for computer science. Topics include time complexity analysis and big-O notation, searching and sorting, linked lists, stacks, queues, priority queues, lists, binary trees, B-trees, AVL trees, splay trees, graphs, and hash tables. Analysis of algorithms including mergesort, quicksort, heapsort. Graph theory, including shortest paths, topological sort, depth-first search, minimum spanning tree. If time permits, any of the following topics: tries, Huffman codes, branch and bound, Fibonacci heaps, critical path analysis, Open Shortest Path first (OSPF), and basic encryption algorithms.
